Getting Started with Wiring-x86
===============================

Here are some easy instructions to get you up and running with the
``wiring-x86.py`` module.


Prerequisites
--------------

The ``wiring-x86.py`` module is meant to be used on Intel速 Galileo Gen2
platform with its original YOCTO Linux OS. For more information on the Intel速
Galileo Gen2 board and how to get this software go to `Intel速 Makers site
<https://communities.intel.com/community/makers>`_. This module will only work
with that combination of board and OS since it uses the Intel速 Galileo Gen2
GPIO driver sysfs interface.

The ``wiring-x86.py`` module also requires Python 2.7 which is installed as standard on


Installing Wiring-x86
---------------------

The first step is to install the Wiring-x86 module. There are several ways to
do this.

Using PIP
*********

If available, the `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html>`_
installer is the preferred method for installing Python modules from `PyPI
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_, the Python Package Index::

    $ sudo pip install wiring-x86

Using Easy_Install
******************

If ``pip`` isn't available on your system then `easy_install
<http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall>`_ may be::

    $ sudo easy_install wiring-x86

Installing from a tarball
*************************

If you download a tarball of the latest version of wiring-x86 you can install
it as follows (change the version number to suit)::

    $ tar -zxvf wiring-x86-1.2.3.tar.gz

    $ cd wiring-x86-1.2.3
    $ sudo python setup.py install

A tarball of the latest code can be downloaded from GitHub as follows::

    $ curl -O -L http://github.com/emutex/wiring-x86/archive/master.tar.gz

    $ tar zxvf master.tar.gz
    $ cd wiring-x86-master/
    $ sudo python setup.py install


Cloning from GitHub
*******************

The Wiring-x86 source code and bug tracker is in the
`wiring-x86 repository <http://github.com/emutex/wiring-x86>`_ on GitHub.

You can clone the repository and install from it as follows::

    $ git clone https://github.com/emutex/wiring-x86.git

    $ cd wiring-x86
    $ sudo python setup.py install


Running a sample program
------------------------

The ``wiring-x86`` repository and tarball includes several example
programs. There are also shown in the :ref:`ex` section.
